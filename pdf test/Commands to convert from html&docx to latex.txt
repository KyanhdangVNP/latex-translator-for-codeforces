BEFORE YOU FOLLOW THE GUIDE, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DO THESE FOLLOWINGS:
- Install this library first or else things wouldn't work: pandoc (https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- Install this Python library if you want to convert from .pdf to .tex: pdfminer



||----- PRE-STEP -----||

For HTML -> LATEX: (if you only have .mhtml file): Convert from .mhtml to .html through this link:
https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/mhtml-to-html.html
(remember to save as type "Webpage, Complete (*.htm;*.html)")



||----- STEPS -----||

STEP 1: Open cmd.exe in the current folder and type down these lines of command (MUST HAVE INSTALLED PANDOC BEFORE):

- For HTML -> LATEX:
chcp 65001
pandoc -f html+tex_math_dollars+tex_math_single_backslash -t latex input.html -o output.tex
(The .html file must have name "input.html", the output file would be "output.tex")

- For DOCX -> LATEX:
pandoc -s input.docx -o output.tex

- for PDF -> LATEX:
- Convert from .pdf to .html first with Python library "pdfminer" using the following command on cmd:
pdf2txt.py -t latex input.pdf --force-node-api-uncaught-exceptions-policy=true --trace-deprecation



STEP 2: Close cmd.exe, now run file postprocessing.py so that it will replace all substrings "\(" and "\)" into "$" so that the math notation will be appeared when showing it in Latex type.

* WARNING!! *
*EXTRA STEPS (you have to do it manually because there're some that postprocessing.py can't do it by itself):
- there's nothing for you to do with manually.w., yayy~
* END OF WARNING! *

STEP 3: DONE!!!! The output file would be output_postprocessed.tex :DD have a nice day
