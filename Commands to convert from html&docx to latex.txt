pre-step:

For HTML -> LATEX: (if you only have .mhtml file): Convert from .mhtml to .html through this link:
https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/mhtml-to-html.html
(remember to save as type "Webpage, Complete (*.htm;*.html)")



Step 1: Open cmd.exe in the current folder and type down these lines of command (MUST HAVE INSTALLED PANDOC BEFORE):

For HTML -> LATEX:
chcp 65001
pandoc -f html+tex_math_dollars+tex_math_single_backslash -t latex input.html -o output.tex
(The .html file must have name "input.html", the output file would be "output.tex")

For DOCX -> LATEX:
pandoc -s input.docx -o output.tex



Step 2: Close cmd.exe, now run file postprocessing.py so that it will replace all substrings "\(" and "\)" into "$" so that the math notation will be appeared when showing it in Latex type.

* WARNING!! *
*EXTRA STEPS (you have to do it manually because there're some that postprocessing.py can't do it by itself):
- there's nothing for you to do with manually.w., yayy -
* END OF WARNING! *

Step 3: DONE!!!! The output file would be output_postprocessed.tex :DD have a nice day

Kyanhdang!
