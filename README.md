# Latex translator for Codeforces and things
This tutorial may help you with translating .html, .mhtml, .docx and .pdf files into .tex file (after some post-processing) to be used as statement for problems in Polygon to use in Codeforces contests.
Check how to convert from .html, .mhtml, .docx files to .tex files [here.](Commands%20to%20convert%20from%20html%26docx%20to%20latex.txt)

If you want to convert from .pdf files to .tex files, check on [this folder.](pdf%20test) (Be careful! It is still in test, although it has succeeded with some .pdf files!!)
